It involves finding observations that deviate significantly from the expected or normal behavior. Anomalies can represent valuable insights, rare events, or potential anomalies such as fraudulent transactions, network intrusions, equipment failures, or health anomalies. Anomaly detection techniques utilize statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, or domain-specific knowledge to distinguish between normal and anomalous data points. The goal is to flag or alert on these anomalies for further investigation or appropriate actions."
