It is suitable when the categorical variable has an inherent ordinal relationship or when there are a large number of categories, and one-hot encoding would lead to high dimensionality. For example, if the categorical variable is \"Habitat\" with categories like \"Forest,\" \"Desert,\" and \"Ocean,\" label encoding can be applied as there is an implied order among the habitats.\n",

It creates binary columns for each category, where the presence or absence of a category is indicated by a value of 1 or 0, respectively. One-hot encoding is appropriate when there is no ordinal relationship among the categories, and each category should be treated as a distinct feature. For example, if the categorical variable is \"Species\" with categories like \"Lion,\" \"Tiger,\" and \"Elephant,\" one-hot encoding would be suitable as there is no inherent order among the species.\n",
