They provide a summary of the data in terms of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode), variability (e.g., range, standard deviation), and shape (e.g., skewness, kurtosis). Descriptive statistics can be used to identify patterns and trends in the data, and to provide a simple and easy-to-understand summary of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Suppose you want to summarize the test scores of a class of 30 students. You can use descriptive statistics to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the scores to get a sense of the overall performance of the class. You could also plot a histogram or box plot to visualize the distribution of the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics are used to make inferences and draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. They involve using probability theory to determine how likely it is that a certain result occurred by chance. Inferential statistics can be used to test hypotheses, make predictions, and generalize findings from a sample to a larger population.\n",
    "    Example: Suppose you want to know whether a new teaching method has an impact on test scores. You could randomly assign some students to be taught using the new method and others to be taught using the traditional method, and then compare the test scores of the two groups using inferential statistics. Specifically, you could use a statistical test such as a t-test to determine whether the difference in mean test scores between the two groups is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. If the difference is significant, you could infer that the new teaching method has an effect on test scores."
