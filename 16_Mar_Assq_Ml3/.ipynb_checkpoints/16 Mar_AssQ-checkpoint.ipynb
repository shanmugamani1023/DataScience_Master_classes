If the model performs significantly better on the training data than on the validation or test set, it is likely overfitting. Conversely, if the model's performance is poor on both the training and validation/test sets, it may be underfitting.\n",

If the training and validation/test curves converge at a high performance level, the model is likely not overfitting. However, if the validation/test curve lags significantly behind the training curve, it indicates overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cross-validation: Perform k-fold cross-validation by splitting the data into k subsets and evaluating the model's performance on each fold. If there is a significant performance discrepancy between the training and validation/test folds, it suggests overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Visual inspection: Plot the model's predictions against the actual values for a subset of the data. If the predictions closely follow the true values, the model may not be overfitting. However, if there are large deviations or inconsistencies, it could indicate overfitting or underfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. L1 Regularization (Lasso): L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute values of the model's weights. It encourages sparse weight values and promotes feature selection by driving some weights to zero. L1 regularization can help in feature selection and model interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. L2 Regularization (Ridge): L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the squared values of the model's weights. It encourages small weight values and effectively reduces the impact of individual weights. L2 regularization helps in reducing the magnitude of weights and preventing excessive sensitivity to individual data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Elastic Net Regularization: Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 regularization by adding a linear combination of their penalty terms to the loss function. It provides a balance between the sparsity-inducing properties of L1 regularization and the regularization of L2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dropout Regularization: Dropout regularization randomly drops out a fraction of units or connections during the training process. By doing so, it prevents the model from relying too heavily on specific features or relationships. Dropout acts as a form of model averaging and encourages the network to learn more robust representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Early Stopping: Early stopping is a technique where the training process is halted when the model's performance on a validation set starts to deteriorate. It prevents the model from overfitting by finding the point of optimal performance before it starts to over-adapt to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These regularization techniques add penalty terms or introduce specific mechanisms during the training process to discourage overfitting. They effectively control the model's complexity, reduce the impact of individual weights, encourage sparsity, or promote more robust learning. By applying regularization techniques, models can generalize better and perform well on unseen data."
